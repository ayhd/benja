  As I attempt, once again, to re-live the wonder years of World of Warcraft through the upcoming Wildstar
  I'm starting to wonder if the issue is not in fact 'MMO burnout' but the widening of the gameplay gap between an
  MMO and a 'regular' game. I have toiled through multiple attempts at getting back into WoW as well as trying new games
  like Conan, Rift, Tera and Wildstar but each attempt has ended after a few (tens of) hours when the grind becomes
  evident. It seems to be getting harder and harder to really enjoy an MMO like I did in the BC and WotLK era of World of Warcraft.

  Lets break down a WoW style MMO. It's an epic role playing game, driven by storylines played out through questing.
  It has a combat system that dodges technological limitations, relying on hotkey rotations, reactions, positioning
  and movement to deliver challenge. It has a social experience that rewards organisation, communiction and teamwork.
  There is also a friendship component that encourages people to keep coming back,
  to form real friendships and help others out.

<p>
  In the past 10 years since World of Warcraft was released we have seen an evolution of the genre.
  Gameplay has been tweaked to allow group looting, questing has become more dynamic with novel gimmicks to help hide
  the basic kill, deliver, gather or escort quest types. Graphics, net code and engine improvements have done their bit,
  although I do often see "It looks good...for an MMO" in reviews for newly released games.
  The difficulty has generally been lowered, with wipes in dungeons limited to trying to pull the whole instance at
  once or when the healer going afk. The social experience depends more on what your friends are playing than the game itself.

<h2>The Gap</h2>

<p>
  While MMO's have evolved, they havent evolved at the same pace as many other genres.
</p>

<p>
  Take Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II, released the same year as WoW and compare it with a modern
  day RPG like Fallout New Vegas, Skyrim, Mass Effect Trilogy or The Witcher 2.
  As you would expect, years of combat mechanics, graphical, story telling and scale improvements show.
</p>
<p>
  Take FPS's as another example, 2004 was a time before gun unlock progression and the rise of the present day/near
  future miltary shooter.  Call of Duty was only bringing out its first ever expansion, the kings of multiplayer were
  Unreal Tournament 2004 on the PC and Halo 1 on the consoles. The combat mechanics, voice acting, scale and sheer amount
  of content has improved dramatically.
</p>
<p>
  The changes are not as subtle as the ones made to MMO's over the past decade. In fact comparing WoW to Wildstar shows
  how little has changed. When so little has changed, as so much time needs to be invested to get into a MMO, it's no
  surprise that people are so burnt out by the MMO genre.
</p>
<p>
  My point is the differences between an MMO today and 10 years ago are smaller than other genres.
  Lets pretend both MMO's and single player RPG's started out at level 5 in 2004.
  Over the past years they have both been leveling. MMO's have leveled up to level 15 - quite a nice progression.
  RPG's have been power leveling and have raced to level 25. When you compare the 2 the MMO looks tired, boring and slow.
  A lot of the "innovation" in recent MMO's is nothing more than catching up or trying to emulate single player RPG's of years ago.
  Why would I play a MMO with inferior mechanics, graphics and story when I could play a real RPG. The only reason I can
  think of is for the social aspect. It's a shame none of my friends still play MMO's.
