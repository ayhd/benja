    Aligning some text next to a div (or image or icon) can be quite confusing and counter-intuitive.
    Its one of those problems that appear  enough to be annoying but not enough to remember the fix for next time.
</p>
<p>
    In the following examples I will an icon as an example,
    but the same will apply for an image or any other block element.
</p>

<h2> What usually happens </h2>
<p>
    floating the icon to the left is usually enough, as long as the text isn't taller than the element. If it is longer,
    the text wraps under the element.

<h2> Element to the left of the text, text doesn't wrap below element </h2>
<p>
    I found this cool trick to stop the text wrapping underneath the element.
    This looks similar to a unordered list, where the 2nd line indents.
    Some might argue that a semantically correct html list should be used instead of this trick,
    but there are cases when you're not trying to create a list.
</p>
<p>
    The fix is a simple 1 line CSS change:
    <pre>
        .text {
            overflow: hidden;
        }
    </pre>
</p>
