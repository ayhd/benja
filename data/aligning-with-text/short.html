    Aligning some text next to a div (or image or icon) can be quite confusing and counter-intuitive.
    Its one of those problems that appear  enough to be annoying but not enough to remember the fix for next time.

    In the following examples I will an icon as an example,
    but the same will apply for an image or any other block element.
