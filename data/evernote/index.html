    A square peg doesn’t fit a round hole, but what if the peg was a hexagon and a little bit smaller than the hole?
    <a href=“http://evernote.com”>Evernote</a> is the almost great solution to so many of my needs over the past 3 years.
</p>

<h2>Why Evernote?</h2>
<p>
    Evernote in its most basic form is cloud storage for notes taken using a WYSIWYG style editor on your computer or device.
    It offers a simple folder structure and tag system to keep things organised.
    It’s real power comes from its Jack-of-all-trades approach.
    Here are just some of the uses I have for my own Evernote account:
</p>

<h3>A simple todo list</h3>
<p>
    A todo can be created instantly by adding a checkbox at the start of each item.
    Checked items are persistant, and the easily editable format allows you add or remove items as needed
</p>
<h3>Getting Things Done</h3>
<p>
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">GTD</a> is a great way to organise and plan things
    without actually doing much organising and planing. Evernote is a quick way to start getting things done instead of
    spending all your time getting things ready.
</p>
<p> I have also had success using Evernote as a personal Kanban and for Pomodoro tracking </p>

<h3>The thing you have in front of you when making an call or talking to someone</h3>
<p>
    Instead of taking notes on the back of an envelope or a post-it note (other brands are avaliable),
    Evernote is a great place to put notes that might be either useless and deleted tomorrow or something
    important that you need in 6 months time.
</p>

<h3>Collaboration</h3>
<p>
    Creating a shared notebook is great for planing a trip,
    including logging itinerary information and being a repository for links to places to visit and things to do.
    I also share notebooks with work colleges to collaborate on things that only need to be worked on by a couple of people.
    It’s a great way to avoid email chains.
</p>

<h3> So, whats the catch? </h3>
<p>
    Each of my examples above can be done better with other tools.
    Many compromises need to be made and you will rarely end up with Evernote working exactly as you wanted.
    I have lost count the number of times I have Googled a question about a feature or task I wanted Evernote to do,
    only to find that it can’t do it. Simple things like resizing images, writing in markdown,
    using an Australian spelling dictionary instead of the US and placing a notebook inside a notebook are all
    impossible within Evernote. The formatting inside the WYSIWYG is very limited, especially when using tables.
</p>
<p>
    This might seem like a bit of a rant, and to a certain extent it actually is.
    Evernote could be the greatest thing since sliced bread but it falls short in so many ways. But it is this simplicity
    and lack of features that make it so generic, so happy to do anything. There are so many uses for Evernote,
    so many improvements that could be made, so many tweaks that would make Evernote perfect for a single use case.
    Each tweak takes time, adds bloat to the software and takes away from the core core focus of the app - to be a digital notebook.
</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>
    Evernote is my go-to app when I need to do anything quickly. Where is works, it works well.
    Where it falls short, there is often a work around or a compromise that isn't too bad. Failing that there is a better
    tool out there, but you might as well jot down some notes while you find it and wait for it to load up.
