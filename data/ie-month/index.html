    A month ago I decided to give IE a go as my "daily driver" browser. I used it to develop with and for general
    browsing.
</p>
<p>
    Why? Because I haven't used internet explorer as a full time browser for about 10 years. It has a reputation for
    being slow, lacking features and being non-standards compliant, especially for developers who need to support it.
    But this isnt 2006, IE7 isn't the latest version, IE11 is. Maybe IE11 is just as good as Chrome but I haven't noticed?
</p>
<p>
    Probably the biggest thing I took away from this experiment is how much I rely on the familiarity of my workspace.
    The first couple of hours with IE11 were a nightmare. No bookmarks, no history, Bing, unfamiliar
    settings and dev tools all made for an uneasy feeling that had me reaching for Chrome. However, once I got those things
    sorted and synced from Chome, my password manager extension installed and tweaking settings to my liking I quickly
    became much more comfortable. It's amazing how much I used to dislik using IE11 to debug and test with because of a couple of
    settings that were not to my liking out of the box.
</p>
<h2>What I liked about IE11</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
      Dev tools are nice to use. They even include some features that have only recently been added to Chrome like the colour picker.
      The ability to emulate older browsers is somthing nice that is also worth mentioning, although that is already widely known.
    </li>
    <li>
      Everything works. There was not a single site I visted over the month that didn't work in IE, and I never noticed any
      lack of style features or animations.
    </li>
    <li>
      I often found myself forgetting I was using IE. To me that is a good sign.
    </li>
    <li>
      Developing in IE and therefore developing IE first allows quick testing for IE8 and IE9.
    </li>
    <li>
      IE11 is customisable. I could fiddle with a lot of settings to get it exactly how I liked it.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>What I didn't like about IE11</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Speed was noticibly slower, especially for JavaScript rendering. Many JavaScript heavy sites take a little longer to load,
    but it was Google Play Music that caused the most pain for me. Everything worked, but there was often little stutters in
    the music playback. This may have more to do with Google not optimising thier code for IE than IE itself, but either way
    I found it annoying.
  </li>
  <li>
    Lack of extensions. I actually thought I would miss these more than I did, but it was still a pain point for me. The 2
    extentions I did manage to get on IE required a restart of Windows!
  </li>
  <li>
    Syncing is terrible. While it is possible to sync my favorites between my Windows 8 and Windows 10 PC's,
    I am left in the dark at work. Syncing involves linking a Microsoft account to you Windows 8 or 10 OS, then waiting for
    the favorites to sync, or in my case, be deleted in favour of synced favorites from a couple of years ago. There is
    no way I found to sync history, extensions or currently open tabs.
  </li>
  <li>
    Windows only. One of the nicest features of Chrome (and other cross platform browsers) is being able to
    sync extensions and bookmarks across my devices at home and work. With no support for Android or Mac,
    half my devices couldnt even run IE. It is possible to run Windows across all devices, but IE hasn't convinced me
    to drop Android in favour of Windows Phone.
  </li>
</ul>
