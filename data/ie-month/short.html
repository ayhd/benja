    A month ago I decided to give IE a go as my "daily driver" browser. I used it to develop with and for general
    browsing.

    Why? Because I haven't used internet explorer as a full time browser for about 10 years. It has a reputation for
    being slow, lacking features and being non-standards compliant, especially for developers who need to support it.
    But this isnt 2006, IE7 isn't the latest version, IE11 is. Maybe IE11 is just as good as Chrome but I haven't noticed?
