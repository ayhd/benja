<p>
  Animations in Angular are feature rich and powerful. They are also confusing
  and can be quite frustrating.
</p>
<p>
  The confusion can be compounded when searching for answers. The way they work
  was dramatically changed in Angular 1.2 and there is a lot of older information
  floating around. This little refresher will hopfully help jog my memory (and maybe your's too) for next
  time.

<h2>The setup</h2>

<p>
  Remember to inject the ngAnimate module and include the angular-animation.min.js file.
</p>

<p>The html</p>
<pre>

  &lt;div ng-show="showHello" class="hello animate"&gt;
    hello
  &lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<p>Animating ng-show and ng-hide</p>

<pre>
  /*
   * The All important display block (or inline-block)
   * This overrides the default ng-hide's display: none
   */
  .animate.ng-hide-add,
  .animate.ng-hide-remove {
    display:inline-block!important;
  }

  /*
   * The transition
   * note: it is applied to the same class as above and has
   * only been seperated for this demonstration
   */
  .animate.ng-hide-add,
  .animate.ng-hide-remove {
    -webkit-transition:all linear 1s;
    -moz-transition:all linear 1s;
    -o-transition:all linear 1s;
    transition:all linear 1s;
  }

  /*
   * start state
   * this is where it gets confusing.
   */
  .animate.ng-hide-add.ng-hide-add-active, /* Applied when the ng-hide is being added */
  .animate.ng-hide-remove { /* Applied when ng-hide is being removed */
    opacity:0;
  }

   /*
   * End state
   * Its still confusing
   */
  .animate.ng-hide-add, /* Applied when ng-hide is being added */
  .animate.ng-hide-remove.ng-hide-remove-active { /* applied when ng-hide is being removed */
    opacity:1;
  }

</pre>
